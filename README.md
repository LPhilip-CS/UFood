# UFood üç®
The UFood Data Analyst Project is designed to delve beyond standard data visualization, aiming to uncover meaningful insights and establish cause-and-effect relationships within the food delivery app's user data. 
This comprehensive exploration includes the identification of characteristic features among respondents, proposing a customer segmentation strategy based on behaviors, and leveraging visualizations to optimize marketing performance.

Below is a brief overview to help you navigate through the project:

## Project Objective:
- Explore the data - Provide insights, and define cause and effect. Provide a better understanding of the characteristic features of respondents.
- Propose and describe a customer segmentation based on customers' characteristics and behaviors
- Visualize data and provide written reasoning behind discoveries
- Well-defined customer segments with tailored marketing recommendations.
- Recommendations for optimizing marketing activities, especially campaigns, to maximize effectiveness.

## Dataset:
- The dataset includes sales and demographic information about the food delivery app.
- Key variables include campaigns, marital status, age, education, amount spent, and more.
- Access the dataset through the 'u_food_marketing' file in the Resources folder.
- Other files included in the resources folder include the Case scenario, and dictionary to help guide the analysis. 


## Project Structure: (All 3 parts are done simultaneously in Python via Jupyter Notebook)
Data Cleaning: 
- Addresses missing values, and outliers, and standardizes formats.
- Combine redundant columns 
- Ensure data integrity and format consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Uncover nuanced insights within the data beyond basic means and counts.
- Discover trends and relationships between attributes.
- Establish cause-and-effect relationships to better understand user behaviors.
- Explore correlations between accepted campaigns and other variables using the correlation coefficient (if applicable).
- Provide a detailed analysis of characteristic features exhibited by respondents in their interaction with the UFood app.
  
Visualization:
- Utilize heatmaps, bar graphs, scatter plots, and more to represent variations in sales, campaigns, and across other variables.
